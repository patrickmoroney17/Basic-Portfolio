            <p>
                My name is Patrick Moroney and I am a highly motivated and conscientious IT Project Manager with over 15
                years’ experience, providing effective leadership and problem resolution, in both small (MNI) and large
                (Prudential, Optum / UHG) corporate environments. I have excellent communication skills and I can work
                under pressure efficiently to meet deadlines.
            </p>
            <p>
                While my most recent job experiences have been project / application development management, in an
                effort to return to my technical coding roots, I recently completed Rutger’s Coding Bootcamp -- a
                12-week Full Stack Flex course aimed at providing the necessary knowledge and skills to build dynamic end-to-end
                web applications and become a full stack web developer. The program was rigorous and fast-paced,
                covering both the theory and application of web development.
            </p>
            <p>
                Working as a contractor this past year, I enjoyed successes at Prudential and CareCentrix. As a member
                Prudential’s PMO, I participated in a project to replace Prudential’s actuarial valuation system,
                defining data flows from the Annuity Administrative Systems -> Snapshot Data Lake -> ETL -> In-force
                Data Warehouse -> Calculation Engine -> Liability Warehouse -> FASB Compliant Reserves. At CareCentrix I
                worked as a core team member tasked with cutting over existing Oracle data warehouses to RAC for QA and
                production environments
            </p>
            <p>
                Successes at Optum include delivering a replacement Affordable Care Act portal for the taxpayers of
                Massachusetts. Working both onsite and remote from Optum’s NJ Delivery Center, I worked closely with the
                software vendor, QA Leads, Release Management, infrastructure / operations partners, vendors, and
                business owners to drive process improvement, and add new features via continuous delivery over a 3-year
                period. Other work included participating in the design team of Optum’s proprietary Integrated
                Eligibility / ACA portal (data warehouse design, process flows, etc.), and management support for the
                Vermont HIX, West Virginia Operations and Maintenance engagements.

                As Manager of Technology at MNI – a small newswire focused on fixed income and foreign exchange news &
                data, successes include overhauling their global news filing system, delivering a robust state of the
                art J2EE multi-datacenter solution feeding platforms like Bloomberg and Reuters. Another success was
                leading the development of an algorithmic data feed product for high frequency trading applications. The
                application was developed in house, and involved building out global telecommunication and server farm
                infrastructure in data centers in the US, Europe, and Asia. The result was one of the fastest products
                available.
